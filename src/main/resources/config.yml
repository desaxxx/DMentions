# (!) Group getters work with LuckPerms weighting system so you might need to assign them one.
# (!) All the 'cooldown' values are representing in seconds.
# (!) Includes hex color support for messages and display. Usage: <#RRGGBB>
# (!) Messages are in lang directory since v1.3.
# (!) You should leave values empty to remove them. Otherwise, the plugin will regenerate them with default values.
#     (e.g. cooldown: 0, disabled_worlds: [], sound: "", ...)
# (!) Sound patterns changed since v1.7.
#     See the sound list with command /playsound (without "minecraft:"), or take a look at the website https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/sound_list_pc.php
